Don’t miss the eighth book in the series that’s been described as “a combination of Carl Hiaasen’s Flush and Janet Evanovich’s Stephanie Plum books” (School Library Journal) and hailed as “nonstop whodunits” (Kirkus Reviews)! The artsy crowd thinks Sammy Keyes has a lot of nerve showing up at a fancy reception in high-tops. But when she tackles a robber who’s brandishing a gun with one hand and pulling paintings from the wall with the other, they’re glad she has nerve. Or are they? Sammy may have stopped one criminal, but the real crime at this show has yet to be discovered. The real crime is more subtle, more artful, than anything Sammy’s ever seen. Who knew art could be so dangerous? Praise for the Sammy Keyes series: “If Kinsey Millhone ever hires a junior partner, Sammy Keyes will be the first candidate on the list. She’s feisty, fearless, and funny. A top-notch investigator!” —New York Times bestselling author Sue Grafton “The sleuth delights from start to finish. Keep your binoculars trained on Sammy Keyes.” —Publishers Weekly “The most winning junior detective ever in teen lit.

Now he writes to his older, wiser Uncle Bill, ""I'd like to ask you... what part suffering will play in my life."" Uncle Bill responds, and thus begins a series of personal letters from the seasoned Christian worker to encourage and guide his young relative in the Christian life. As we read these letters, we too gain great help and insight into how God transforms our character and fashions us into the image of Christ. The cross, suffering, transformation and God's ultimate purpose are the issues that unfold in this unique book by Gene Edwards. Though written for the new believer, it speaks with a depth and newness that will arrest even the most mature believer. The story spans time, space and eternity to deliver its beautiful, moving and profound message.

Yet many still find it difficult to capture the collective intelligence of their employees and customers. Companies don't know what they know--but they need to learn soon. Thanks to a new class of collaborative technologies, organizations can now leverage information in valuable new ways, including: capturing accumulated knowledge; connecting employees who need information with the experts who have it; and enabling the best ideas to emerge organically. These technologies--labeled ""Web 2.0""--first appeared on the Internet, where they powered successful social communities and collaborative platforms like Facebook and Wikipedia. Web 2.0 tools, practices, and philosophies are now being deployed by a wide range of organizations, making them more agile, productive, and innovative. This is the phenomenon of Enterprise 2.0. In this compelling book, Andrew McAfee--a veteran researcher and writer on the business impact of technology, and the originator of the phrase ""Enterprise 2.0""describes the power of Enterprise 2.0 and shows readers how to harness it. McAfee weaves together case studies, discussions of technological change, and multidisciplinary research to: - Show how early adopters like Google, the BBC, and the CIA have profited from Enterprise 2.0 - Specify the concrete business benefits that arise when Web 2.0 technologies are properly deployed - Reveal where the real risks and roadblocks are with Enterprise 2.0, and why most concerns are unfounded - Guide companies through an Enterprise 2.0 deployment Enterprise 2.0 is written not for technology experts, but for pragmatic decision makers in any kind of organization.

A native Southerner, he was a former slave owner and Confederate soldier, but as a member of Congress Hilliard strongly opposed secession. Hilliard supported the constitutional legality of slavery; however, as a moderate he acknowledged the status quo and warned of the dangers of radical positions concerning the issue. Throughout a diverse career that spanned six decades, Hilliard’s personal challenges, moderated by his faith in Divine Providence, eventually allowed him to return to his ideological roots and find a sense of redemption late in life by becoming an unlikely spokesman for the Brazilian emancipation movement through his association with Joaquim Nabuco. In A Journey in Brazil, authors David I. Durham and Paul M.

The first edition of Architect?, published in 1985, quickly became known as the best basic guide to the architectural profession. More than a decade later, it is a standard text for introductory courses on architecture and recommended reading on the application forms of many schools of architecture. This revised edition includes new information pertinent to current education and practice and addresses issues and concerns of great interest to students choosing among different types of programs, schools, firms, and architectural career paths. Roger K. Lewis, a practicing architect and educator, takes a hard look at the education of the architect as he covers such topics as curriculum content, pedagogical theories and methods, program and faculty types, the admission process, internship, compensation, computer-aided design, and the culture of small and large firms. He tells how an architect works and gets work, and explains all aspects of architectural services, from initial client contact to construction oversight. The author describes the benefits of becoming an architect, including the opportunity to express oneself creatively, to improve the environment, and to achieve notoriety. But he doesn't hesitate to show the other side—the lack of steady work and appropriate compensation, the intensity of competition, the restrictions imposed by clients, and the high degree of anxiety and disillusionment among young architects.

John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Dahmer. The names of notorious serial killers are usually well-known; they echo in the news and in public consciousness. But most people have never heard of Israel Keyes, one of the most ambitious and terrifying serial killers in modern history. The FBI considered his behavior unprecedented. Described by a prosecutor as ""a force of pure evil,"" Keyes was a predator who struck all over the United States. He buried ""kill kits""--cash, weapons, and body-disposal tools--in remote locations across the country. Over the course of fourteen years, Keyes would fly to a city, rent a car, and drive thousands of miles in order to use his kits. He would break into a stranger's house, abduct his victims in broad daylight, and kill and dispose of them in mere hours. And then he would return home to Alaska, resuming life as a quiet, reliable construction worker devoted to his only daughter. When journalist Maureen Callahan first heard about Israel Keyes in 2012, she was captivated by how a killer of this magnitude could go undetected by law enforcement for over a decade. And so began a project that consumed her for the next several years--uncovering the true story behind how the FBI ultimately caught Israel Keyes, and trying to understand what it means for a killer like Keyes to exist. A killer who left a path of monstrous, randomly committed crimes in his wake--many of which remain unsolved to this day. American Predator is the ambitious culmination of years of interviews with key figures in law enforcement and in Keyes's life, and research uncovered from classified FBI files. Callahan takes us on a journey into the chilling, nightmarish mind of a relentless killer, and to the limitations of traditional law enforcement.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2uV8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Instead of an orphaned foster child like herself, he is the scion of a billionaire. In order to avoid a family legacy, he faked his own death. When they first met sixteen years ago, Ali was convinced Ryan was a man who grew up like she did: as a foster care orphan. They married quickly and headed for the Midwest to complete college. Sixteen years later, Ryan has an independent law practice, Ali is an ER nurse, and the couple has the perfect life. Yet when Ryan leads a class action suit against a toxic industrial development by billionaire Charles Barnett, all hell breaks loose. During the case discovery, Ali learns that Ryan is really the sole son and namesake of real estate magnate Barnett who faked his death by disappearing off his sailboat near the Massachusetts coast sixteen years ago. His real name is Charles Barnett Jr., and he pulled off his deception in order to avoid the pressure of the family legacy and to marry Ali who came from a lower social status. He took the name Ryan, assuming the legal identity of a college roommate who died young. This searing novel demonstrates the strength of love and the power of class to haunt our lives while serving as a moving meditation on how to redeem the past.

What, then, are we to make of the waves of Western missionaries who have, for centuries, been evangelizing in the global South? Were they merely, as many have argued, agents of imperialism out to impose Western values? In An Unpredictable Gospel, Jay Case examines the efforts of American evangelical missionaries in light of this new scholarship. He argues that if they were agents of imperialism, they were poor ones. Western missionaries had a dismal record of converting non-Westerners to Christianity. The ministries that were most successful were those that empowered the local population and adapted to local cultures. In fact, influence often flowed the other way, with missionaries serving as conduits for ideas that shaped American evangelicalism.

A native Southerner, he was a former slave owner and Confederate soldier, but as a member of Congress Hilliard strongly opposed secession. Hilliard supported the constitutional legality of slavery; however, as a moderate he acknowledged the status quo and warned of the dangers of radical positions concerning the issue. Throughout a diverse career that spanned six decades, Hilliard’s personal challenges, moderated by his faith in Divine Providence, eventually allowed him to return to his ideological roots and find a sense of redemption late in life by becoming an unlikely spokesman for the Brazilian emancipation movement through his association with Joaquim Nabuco. In A Journey in Brazil, authors David I. Durham and Paul M.

John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Dahmer. The names of notorious serial killers are usually well-known; they echo in the news and in public consciousness. But most people have never heard of Israel Keyes, one of the most ambitious and terrifying serial killers in modern history. The FBI considered his behavior unprecedented. Described by a prosecutor as ""a force of pure evil,"" Keyes was a predator who struck all over the United States. He buried ""kill kits""--cash, weapons, and body-disposal tools--in remote locations across the country. Over the course of fourteen years, Keyes would fly to a city, rent a car, and drive thousands of miles in order to use his kits. He would break into a stranger's house, abduct his victims in broad daylight, and kill and dispose of them in mere hours. And then he would return home to Alaska, resuming life as a quiet, reliable construction worker devoted to his only daughter. When journalist Maureen Callahan first heard about Israel Keyes in 2012, she was captivated by how a killer of this magnitude could go undetected by law enforcement for over a decade. And so began a project that consumed her for the next several years--uncovering the true story behind how the FBI ultimately caught Israel Keyes, and trying to understand what it means for a killer like Keyes to exist. A killer who left a path of monstrous, randomly committed crimes in his wake--many of which remain unsolved to this day. American Predator is the ambitious culmination of years of interviews with key figures in law enforcement and in Keyes's life, and research uncovered from classified FBI files. Callahan takes us on a journey into the chilling, nightmarish mind of a relentless killer, and to the limitations of traditional law enforcement.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2uV8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Autumn 1942. Hitler’s legions have swept across Europe; France has fallen; Churchill and the English are isolated on their island. In North Africa, Rommel and his Panzers have routed the British Eighth Army and stand poised to overrun Egypt, Suez, and the oilfields of the Middle East. With the outcome of the war hanging in the balance, the British hatch a desperate plan—send a small, highly mobile, and heavily armed force behind German lines to strike the blow that will stop the Afrika Korps in its tracks. Narrated from the point of view of a young lieutenant, Killing Rommel brings to life the flair, agility, and daring of this extraordinary secret unit, the Long Range Desert Group. Stealthy and lethal as the scorpion that serves as their insignia, they live by their motto: Non Vi Sed Arte—Not by Strength, by Guile as they gather intelligence, set up ambushes, and execute raids. Killing Rommel chronicles the tactics, weaponry, and specialized skills needed for combat, under extreme desert conditions. And it captures the camaraderie of this “band of brothers” as they perform the acts of courage and cunning crucial to the Allies’ victory in North Africa. Combining scrupulous historical detail and accuracy with remarkable narrative momentum, Pressfield powerfully renders the drama and intensity of warfare, the bonds of men in close combat, and the surprising human emotions and frailties that come into play on the battlefield to create a vivid and authoritative depiction of the desert war.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VfaOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Drawing on longitudinal studies going back to the 1960s, he shows that students who attended integrated and well-funded schools were more successful in life than those who did not -- and this held true for children of all races. Yet as a society we have given up on integration. Since the high point of integration in 1988, we have regressed and segregation again prevails.

Yet even after increasing employee salaries and constructing elaborate facilities at a cost of more than $2 billion, the district remained overwhelmingly segregated and student achievement remained far below national averages. Just eight years later the U.S. Supreme Court began reversing these initiatives, signifying a major retreat from Brown v. Board of Education. In Kansas City, African American families opposed to the district court's efforts organized a takeover of the school board and requested that the court case be closed. Joshua Dunn argues that Judge Clark's ruling was not the result of tyrannical ""judicial activism"" but was rather the logical outcome of previous contradictory Supreme Court doctrines. High Court decisions, Dunn explains, necessarily limit the policy choices available to lower court judges, introducing complications the Supreme Court would not anticipate. He demonstrates that the Kansas City case is a model lesson for the types of problems that develop for lower courts in any area in which the Supreme Court attempts to create significant change.

Board of Education--and in spite of increased funding for urban schools and programs like No Child Left Behind--educational opportunities for blacks and whites in America still remain so unequal? In Five Miles Away, A World Apart, James Ryan provides a sobering answer to this question by tracing the fortunes of two schools in Richmond, Virginia--one suburban, relatively affluent, and mostly white, and the other urban, relatively poor, and mostly black. Ryan shows how court rulings against desegregation in the 1970s laid the groundwork for the massive disparities between urban and suburban public school districts that persist to this day. The Nixon administration, intent on shoring up its base in the ""silent majority,"" allowed suburbs to lock nonresidents out of their school systems. Urban schools, whose student bodies were becoming increasingly poor and black, simply received more funding, a panacea that has proven largely ineffective, while the academic independence (and superiority) of suburban schools was held sacrosanct. Drawing on compelling interviews with students, teachers, and principals, including one who has been a principal at both schools featured in the book, Ryan explains how certain policies--school finance, school choice, and standardized testing--not only fail to bridge the performance gap between students at urban and suburban schools but actually perpetuate segregation across the country. Ryan closes by suggesting innovative reforms that would bring greater diversity into our schools by shifting the emphasis from racial to socioeconomic integration. An incisive critique of exactly how and why our educational policies have gone wrong, Five Miles Away, A World Apart will interest all those who wish to see our educational system heal the divide between rich and poor and live up to our highest democratic ideals.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LZqeQbkX8lsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

This histological and embryological information provides a necessary, though often lacking, background for the protein chemist and molecular biologist, and a bridge between biochemistry and biophysics, on the one hand, and clinical medicine, on the other. Thus, major practical problems in human reproduction, such as the mode of action of contraceptive agents and the cause of the initiation of labor, may be approached on a firm scientific footing. This text deals primarily with the biology of the uterus itself (comparative and human) rather than with placentation or pregnancy, and as such is a synthesis of data derived from many techniques, conventional and modern. Inasmuch as it is clearly beyond the competence of anyone scientist to prepare such a text on the basis of personal knowledge and experience, the aid of distinguished biologists from this country and abroad was enlisted.

In this study, Richard K. Reed explores the economic and social basis for this ethnic autonomy. Reed finds that Chiripá economic power derives from their practice of commercial agroforestry. Unlike Latin American indigenous societies that have been forced to clear land for commercial agriculture, the Chiripá continue to harvest and sell forest products, such as caffeinated yerba mate, without destroying the forests. Reed also explores the relation of this complex economy to Chiripá social organization and shows how flexible kin ties allowed the Chiripá to adapt to the pressure and opportunities of the commercial economy without adopting the authoritarian nature of rural Paraguayan society. These findings offer important insights into the relations among indigenous groups, nation-states, and the international economy.

Now, in this groundbreaking book, Harvard Medical School professor and New Yorker staff writer Jerome Groopman shows us why. The search for hope is most urgent at the patient’s bedside. The Anatomy of Hope takes us there, bringing us into the lives of people at pivotal moments when they reach for and find hope--or when it eludes their grasp. Through these intimate portraits, we learn how to distinguish true hope from false, why some people feel they are undeserving of it, and whether we should ever abandon our search. Can hope contribute to recovery by changing physical well-being? To answer this hotly debated question, Groopman embarked on an investigative journey to cutting-edge laboratories where researchers are unraveling an authentic biology of hope. There he finds a scientific basis for understanding the role of this vital emotion in the outcome of illness. Here is a book that offers a new way of thinking about hope, with a message for all readers, not only patients and their families. ""We are just beginning to appreciate hope’s reach,"" Groopman writes, ""and have not defined its limits.

From his description it does not appear whether it was done by the scissors, or by the tubes, in fact not whether it happened in, the stenosed or in the wide side. But it must be remembered that in the stenosed side the tur binals are so small that they offer hardly any surface for being injured, and the blade introduced into the stenosed side is blunt. -\s to the wide side I can not see how the scissors, with some care, should injure the tur binals; but if these should be of an enormous Size, they should be reduced, as stated above, by a preliminary operation. 011 the other hand, it is not easy to under stand how the tubular splints could fracture the tur binals after the reposition of the septum, as all force this is essential and has been reiterated again and again - should be strictly avoided during the introduction. I must therefore conclude that the injury which Dr. Stucky saw in some patients who had been operated on by some other surgeon, must have been due to other causes, or were possibly the handiwork of some one who was in his first attempts at doing this work; and was possibly not sufficiently familiar with the technic and after-treatment. Robert Levy13 reports a case in which, ' thirteen days after this operation had been performed, death occurred, in a rather poorly nourished individual who had been a sufferer from rheumatism and cardiac distress, and who had been addicted to the use of morphin. The cause of death was general septicemia, thrombus of the posterior cerebral artery, and cerebral softening. 'l'he thrombus was evidently due to syphilitic arteritis. This is plainly one of those accidents which are just as unfortunate as they are unavoidable, and which might have as well occurred after any other operation on the septum, or for that matter on the turbinals also.

Robeck, Jr. brings to bear expertise from decades of focused study in church history to reveal the captivating story of the Apostolic Faith Mission in Los Angeles, which became known as the Azusa Street Mission. Sometimes the largest blaze begins with the tiniest spark. At the dawn of the twentieth century, William J. Seymour, the son of Louisiana slaves, began meeting with a tiny congregation in a two-story wooden building in downtown Los Angeles. What began as a spontaneous gathering of believers quickly grew into a passionate revival and renewal of the work of the Holy Spirit. The movement spread at breathtaking speed. With little more than a printing press, a trolley stop, and a powerful message, the spiritual fire emanating from the Apostolic Faith Mission on Azusa Street rapidly crossed strict cultural and national borders—into Mexico, Canada, Britain, Scandinavia, Africa, India, and China. Led by William J. Seymour, the revival became the catalyst for the modern Pentecostal movement. Today, the more than 500 million Christians who identify as Pentecostal or Charismatic can trace the roots of their faith to this humble beginning at Azusa Street.

While this text focuses on sport and recreation practices on these lands now claimed by Canada, it is set within a larger historical context of interconnecting social and cultural practices to speak to the sustained tensions, complexities, and contradictions prevalent in Canadian society. The editor, Dr. Carly Adams, and her 17 contributing experts from across Canada bring the latest research in all areas of Canadian sport history to life and present a thorough look at the nation’s past events. The text challenges the dominant narratives and encourages students to think critically about Canadian sport history. It examines how gender, ethnicity, race, religion, ability, class, and other systems of oppression and privilege have shaped sport and recreation practices, with Canadian sporting culture reproducing many of the same oppressive systems that exist on the larger scale. Sport and Recreation in Canadian History separates itself from its competitors by providing an abundance of pedagogical aids. Sidebars highlighting prominent people provide glimpses of figures who made a significant impact on Canadian sport history. Transformative Moment sidebars focus on significant events as they relate to specific themes, such as gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, or ability. A comprehensive timeline showcases where important events fell in relation to one another, while the text acknowledges the problem of presenting history in a linear way and provides a more nuanced discussion of time. Descriptions of primary source documents—such as newspaper articles, photographs, and historical documents—are accompanied by explanations of how sport historians work with these documents. Sport and Recreation in Canadian History asks readers to think differently about the history of Canadian sport, and it examines how past people, moments, and events continue to shape 21st-century sport.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s3vdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Are we missing greater experiences by confining sex to a physical level?These and other questions are answered in this book, from sources of ancient and modern wisdom, gathered by the author over many years of study and research.Sex is one of the most dominating subjects of our time. It is substituted for love; it is used with love and without love. People are confused about it. Some do not know which sex they are.

Raymond Haberski's provocative and insightful book traces the trajectory of this evolution throughout the twentieth century, from nickelodeon amusements to the age of the financial blockbuster. Haberski begins by looking at the barriers to film's acceptance as an art form, including the Chicago Motion Picture Commission hearings of 1918–1920, one of the most revealing confrontations over the use of censorship in the motion picture industry. He then examines how movies overcame the stigma attached to popular entertainment through such watershed events as the creation of the Museum of Modern Art's Film Library in the 1920s. The arguments between Pauline Kael and Andrew Sarris's heralded a golden age of criticism, and Haberski focuses on the roles of Kael, Sarris, James Agee, Roger Ebert, and others, in the creation of ""cinephilia."" Described by Susan Sontag as ""born of the conviction that cinema was an art unlike any other,"" this love of cinema centered on coffee houses, universities, art theaters, film festivals, and, of course, foreign films. The lively debates over the place of movies in American culture began to wane in the 1970s. Haberski places the blame on the loss of cultural authority and on the increasing irrelevance of the meaning of art. He concludes with a persuasive call for the re-emergence of a middle ground between art and entertainment, ""something more complex, ambiguous, and vexing—something worth thought.""",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p0YoEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Instead of an orphaned foster child like herself, he is the scion of a billionaire. In order to avoid a family legacy, he faked his own death. When they first met sixteen years ago, Ali was convinced Ryan was a man who grew up like she did: as a foster care orphan. They married quickly and headed for the Midwest to complete college. Sixteen years later, Ryan has an independent law practice, Ali is an ER nurse, and the couple has the perfect life. Yet when Ryan leads a class action suit against a toxic industrial development by billionaire Charles Barnett, all hell breaks loose. During the case discovery, Ali learns that Ryan is really the sole son and namesake of real estate magnate Barnett who faked his death by disappearing off his sailboat near the Massachusetts coast sixteen years ago. His real name is Charles Barnett Jr., and he pulled off his deception in order to avoid the pressure of the family legacy and to marry Ali who came from a lower social status. He took the name Ryan, assuming the legal identity of a college roommate who died young. This searing novel demonstrates the strength of love and the power of class to haunt our lives while serving as a moving meditation on how to redeem the past. As Ryan says to his teenage daughter, ""Status does not determine character. Character determines status.""",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UZHhAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

He argues that while anthropologists have oriented themselves to the study of the strangeness of the non-European world and to what are seen as non-rational dimensions of social life (things like myth, taboo, and religion),the modern and the secular have not been adequately examined. The conclusion is that the secular cannot be viewed as a successor to religion, or be seen as on the side of the rational.

Within the last few years, a community of researchers is growing to address issues closer to computer science: the relationship between computing structures and the physical structures that implement them; the specification and verification of computational procosses implemented in VLSI; the use of massively parallel computing made possible by VLSI; the design of special purpose computing architectures; and the changes in general-purpose computer architecture that VLSI makes possible. It is likely that the future exploitation of VLSI technology depends as much on structural and design innovations as on advances in fabrication technology. The book is divided into nine sections: - Invited Papers. Six distinguished researchers from industry and academia presented invited papers. - Models of Computation. The papers in this section deal with abstracting the properties of VLSI circuits into models that can be used to analyze the chip area, time or energy required for a particular computation.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wU3uCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Situating her work around the intersecting publications of Daniel Bell's The End of Ideology (1960) and J.D. Salinger's Franny and Zooey (1961), Laurie Rodrigues argues that American novels express this paradox through nuanced applications of non-realist strategies, distorting realism in manners similar to ideology's distortions of reality, history, and belief. Reflecting the astonishing cultural variety of this period, The American Novel After Ideology, 1961 - 2000 examines Franny and Zooey, Carlene Hatcher Polite's The Flagellants (1967), Leslie Marmon Silko's Almanac of the Dead (1991), and Philip Roth's The Human Stain (2001) alongside the various discussions around ideology with which they intersect.

Having obtained her PhD in microbiology by the age of twenty, she's amassed a wealth of knowledge, but one subject still eludes her—people. The pendulum of passions experienced by those around her both confuses and intrigues her, so when she’s offered a grant to study emotion as a pathogen, she jumps on the opportunity. When her attempts to come up with an actual experiment quickly drop from lackluster to nonexistent, she’s given a choice: figure out how to conduct a groundbreaking study on passion, or lose both the grant and her position at the university. Put on leave until she can crack the perfect proposal, she finds there’s only one way she can study emotions—by experiencing them herself. Enter Jensen Walker, Lucy's neighbor and the one person on the planet she finds strangely and maddeningly appealing. Jensen's life is the stuff of campus legend, messy, emotional, complicated—in short, the perfect starting point for Lucy's study. When her tenaciousness wears him down and he consents to help her, sparks fly. To her surprise, Lucy finds herself battling with her own emotions, as foreign as they are intense.

Social indicators are statistical time series “...used to monitor the social system, helping to identify changes and to guide intervention to alter the course of social change”. Examples include unemployment rates, crime rates, estimates of life expectancy, health status indices, school enrollment rates, average achievement scores, election voting rates, and measures of subjective well-being such as satisfaction with life-as-a-whole and with specific domains or aspects of life. This book provides a review of the historical development of the field including the history of QOL in medicine and mental health as well as the research related to quality-of-work-life (QWL) programs. It discusses several of QOL main concepts: happiness, positive psychology, and subjective wellbeing. Relations between spirituality and religiousness and QOL are examined as are the effects of educational attainment on QOL and marketing, and the associations with economic growth. The book goes on to investigate methodological approaches and issues that should be considered in measuring and analysing quality of life from a quantitative perspective. The final chapters are dedicated to research on elements of QOL in a broad range of countries and populations.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZFuh9pBxS4EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Are we living in a post-truth world, where “alternative facts” replace actual facts and feelings have more weight than evidence? How did we get here? In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, Lee McIntyre traces the development of the post-truth phenomenon from science denial through the rise of “fake news,” from our psychological blind spots to the public's retreat into “information silos.” What, exactly, is post-truth? Is it wishful thinking, political spin, mass delusion, bold-faced lying? McIntyre analyzes recent examples—claims about inauguration crowd size, crime statistics, and the popular vote—and finds that post-truth is an assertion of ideological supremacy by which its practitioners try to compel someone to believe something regardless of the evidence. Yet post-truth didn't begin with the 2016 election; the denial of scientific facts about smoking, evolution, vaccines, and climate change offers a road map for more widespread fact denial. Add to this the wired-in cognitive biases that make us feel that our conclusions are based on good reasoning even when they are not, the decline of traditional media and the rise of social media, and the emergence of fake news as a political tool, and we have the ideal conditions for post-truth. McIntyre also argues provocatively that the right wing borrowed from postmodernism—specifically, the idea that there is no such thing as objective truth—in its attacks on science and facts. McIntyre argues that we can fight post-truth, and that the first step in fighting post-truth is to understand it.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mtuMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

La Follette (1855–1925), the Republican senator from Wisconsin, is best known as a key architect of American Progressivism and as a fiery advocate for liberal politics in the domestic sphere. But ""Fighting Bob"" did not immediately come to a progressive stance on foreign affairs. In The Education of an Anti-Imperialist, Richard Drake follows La Follette's growth as a critic of America's wars and the policies that led to them. He began his political career with conventional Republican views of the era on foreign policy, avidly supporting the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars. La Follette's critique of empire emerged in 1910, during the first year of the Mexican Revolution, as he began to perceive a Washington–Wall Street alliance in the United States' dealings with Mexico. La Follette subsequently became Congress's foremost critic of Woodrow Wilson, fiercely opposing United States involvement in World War I. Denounced in the American press as the most dangerous man in the country, he became hated and vilified by many but beloved and admired by others. La Follette believed that financial imperialism and its necessary instrument, militarism, caused modern wars. He contended they were twin evils that would have ruinous consequences for the United States and its citizens in the twentieth century and beyond. “An excellent book. . . . As Drake fully documents, La Follette's warnings about [World War I] profiteers and the lust for power were fully justified. Then as now, the American people were lied to by the government and media and manipulated into the stink and blood of war.""—Mark Taylor, The Daily Call “Scholars will . . . value the insights into La Follette's foreign policy education.”—The Historian",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qfTPAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Keyes traces the genre's history from its roots in West African bardic traditions, the Jamaican dancehall tradition, and African American vernacular expressions to its permeation of the cultural mainstream as a major tenet of hip-hop lifestyle and culture. Rap music, according to Keyes, is a forum that addresses the political and economic disfranchisement of black youths and other groups, fosters ethnic pride, and displays culture values and aesthetics. Blending popular culture with folklore and ethnomusicology, Keyes offers a nuanced portrait of the artists, themes, and varying styles reflective of urban life and street consciousness. Drawing on the music, lives, politics, and interests of figures including Afrika Bambaataa, the ""godfather of hip-hop,"" and his Zulu Nation, George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, Grandmaster Flash, Kool ""DJ"" Herc, MC Lyte, LL Cool J, De La Soul, Public Enemy, Ice-T, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, and The Last Poets, Rap Music and Street Consciousness challenges outsider views of the genre. The book also draws on ethnographic research done in New York, Los Angeles, Detroit and London, as well as interviews with performers, producers, directors, fans, and managers. Keyes's vivid and wide-ranging analysis covers the emergence and personas of female rappers and white rappers, the legal repercussions of technological advancements such as electronic mixing and digital sampling, the advent of rap music videos, and the existence of gangsta rap, Southern rap, acid rap, and dance-centered rap subgenres. Also considered are the crossover careers of rap artists in movies and television; rapper-turned-mogul phenomenons such as Queen Latifah; the multimedia empire of Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs; the cataclysmic rise of Death Row Records; East Coast versus West Coast tensions; the deaths of Tupac Shakur and Christopher ""The Notorious B.I.G.""

Ethnomusicological scholarship, however, has been remiss in articulating such goals, methods, and theories. A renowned figure in the field, Timothy Rice is one of the few scholars to regularly address this problem. In this volume, he offers a compilation of essays drawn from across his career that finds implicit and yet largely unrecognized patterns unifying ethnomusicology over its recent history. Modeling Ethnomusicology summarizes thirty years of thinking about the field of ethnomusicology as Rice frames and reframes the content of eight of his most important essays from their original context in relation to the environment of today's ethnomusicology. Rice proposes a variety of models meant to guide students and researchers in their study of ethnomusicology. Some of these models pull together disparate strands of the field, while others propose heuristic models that generate questions for researchers as they plan and conduct their research. A new introduction to these essays reviews the history of his writing about ethnomusicology and proposes an innovative model for theorizing in ethnomusicology by ethnomusicologists.

From the football sidelines, the authors reveal the dramatic incident which almost cost the lives of Rose Bowl heroes Bob Griese and George Catavolas at the 1967 Hula Bowl. Also, readers will find out how long-time New York Yankees' owner George Steinbrenner became an assistant coach for the Purdue football team and a quarter century later was instrumental in luring the Boilermakers' NCAA Final Four coach away from ! Purdue. Included are the stories of Purdue's national championship teams; the 1961 golf team which was led by a player that never lost to golfing legend Jack Nicklaus and the triumphant story of the 1999 Purdue women's basketball team surviving three coaching changes en route to a national title.

A policy mandate for such activities appears to be lacking though, which might impact negatively their effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to get a better understanding of the existing policy and implementation mechanisms of after-school activities offered by the Atlanta Fulton Library System in Georgia to at-risk teenaged patrons. Moore's theory of innovation and public value provided the theoretical framework for the study. An embedded case study research design was used to explore the perceived role of the public library, guiding policy framework, and factors constraining the implementation of after-school activities in 3 of the system 20 branches serving at-risk youth; semi-structured interviews with 21 participants comprising teenagers engaged in after-school activities, parents, librarians, library managers, and members of the Friends of the library; observations of teenagers' behaviors in the library setting; and publicly available document on the subject. The data were inductively coded and then subjected to a content analytical procedure, which revealed 5 after-school themes: bridging a digital divide, teen and community needs, public policy, and public service. The key finding of this book indicates an absence of a system-wide formal policy in how after-school services are provided across library systems for at-risk teenagers. The book concludes with recommendations to reexamine the existing after-school programs in a way that better incorporates the unique needs of library patrons and to align policies with these needs in order to better serve at-risk youth within the context of their communities.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SMewswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

That celebration was held in connection with the twenty-third annual convention of the Association in the city of New York, May 17 and 18, 1916. It was an ever-memorable occasion in the history of Savings Banks in the United States, attended by more than five hundred representatives of this great interest from all parts of the country, more especially from New England and the East. Unfortunately, the clamant demands of the war prevented the attendance of delegates from European countries, but they were present in thought and spirit, as their most cordial letters, written amidst all the dangers and distractions of soul-harrowing times and printed in the chapter on the celebration, clearly show. Originally conceived as a small pamphlet to contain the proceedings of the celebration, the work has gradually grown to the proportions of a two-volume edition, embracing in its scope the rise of Savings Banks in Europe and America, a history of each of the so-called pioneer banks of the United States, School and Postal Savings Banks, the Thrift Movement in America, etc., besides numerous chapters of a practical nature on the management of these institutions of the people. In addition to this there is presented an authentic history of each of the 141 Savings Banks in the State of New York, written from first-hand information obtained especially for this work.

Yet many still find it difficult to capture the collective intelligence of their employees and customers. Companies don't know what they know--but they need to learn soon. Thanks to a new class of collaborative technologies, organizations can now leverage information in valuable new ways, including: capturing accumulated knowledge; connecting employees who need information with the experts who have it; and enabling the best ideas to emerge organically. These technologies--labeled ""Web 2.0""--first appeared on the Internet, where they powered successful social communities and collaborative platforms like Facebook and Wikipedia. Web 2.0 tools, practices, and philosophies are now being deployed by a wide range of organizations, making them more agile, productive, and innovative. This is the phenomenon of Enterprise 2.0. In this compelling book, Andrew McAfee--a veteran researcher and writer on the business impact of technology, and the originator of the phrase ""Enterprise 2.0""describes the power of Enterprise 2.0 and shows readers how to harness it. McAfee weaves together case studies, discussions of technological change, and multidisciplinary research to: - Show how early adopters like Google, the BBC, and the CIA have profited from Enterprise 2.0 - Specify the concrete business benefits that arise when Web 2.0 technologies are properly deployed - Reveal where the real risks and roadblocks are with Enterprise 2.0, and why most concerns are unfounded - Guide companies through an Enterprise 2.0 deployment Enterprise 2.0 is written not for technology experts, but for pragmatic decision makers in any kind of organization.

This places an emphasis on understanding not only the platform’s capabilities but also emerging best practices. Joe does a great job interspersing best practices alongside theory throughout his book.” – From the Foreword by Craig Mundie, Chief Research and Strategy Officer, Microsoft Corporation Author Joe Duffy has risen to the challenge of explaining how to write software that takes full advantage of concurrency and hardware parallelism. In Concurrent Programming on Windows, he explains how to design, implement, and maintain large-scale concurrent programs, primarily using C# and C++ for Windows. Duffy aims to give application, system, and library developers the tools and techniques needed to write efficient, safe code for multicore processors. This is important not only for the kinds of problems where concurrency is inherent and easily exploitable—such as server applications, compute-intensive image manipulation, financial analysis, simulations, and AI algorithms—but also for problems that can be speeded up using parallelism but require more effort—such as math libraries, sort routines, report generation, XML manipulation, and stream processing algorithms. Concurrent Programming on Windows has four major sections: The first introduces concurrency at a high level, followed by a section that focuses on the fundamental platform features, inner workings, and API details. Next, there is a section that describes common patterns, best practices, algorithms, and data structures that emerge while writing concurrent software. The final section covers many of the common system-wide architectural and process concerns of concurrent programming. This is the only book you’ll need in order to learn the best practices and common patterns for programming with concurrency on Windows and .NET.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o4ohrd0_yA0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It is oriented primarily towards people who have already acquired some basic knowledge of programming and would like to deepen their understanding in a more structured way. Nevertheless, an introductory chapter is included for the benefit of the beginner, displaying in a concise form some of the fundamental concepts of computers and their programming. The text is therefore also suitable as a self-contained tutorial. The notation used is Modula-2, which lends itself well for a structured approach and leads the student to a working style that has generally become known under the title of structured programming. As a manual for programming in Modula-2, the text covers practically all facilities of that language. Part 1 covers the basic notions of the variable, expression, assignment, conditional and repetitive statement, and array data structure. Together with Part 2 which introduces the important concept of the procedure or subroutine, it contains essentially the material commonly discussed in introductory programming courses. Part 3 concerns data types and structures and constitutes the essence of an advanced course on programming. Part 4 introduces the notion of the module, a concept that is fundamental to the design of larger programmed systems and to programming as team work. The most commonly used utility programs for input and output are presented as examples of modules.

Much new data has been obtained in recent years, in particular from the study of radiation outside the visual region. Many symbiotic stars have been studied in the UV with IUE since 1978, while X-rays were det ected in a few cases with the Einstein satellite. There have been a num ber of infrared and radio studies, and the number of known symbiotic stars has also considerably increased. Furthermore theoretical ideas have in recent years been considerably enriched by concepts of stellar winds, and accretion phenomena in binaries including accretion disks.

Frank Capra called her “the greatest emotional actress the screen has yet known.” Yet Barbara Stanwyck (1907-1990) was also one of its most underrated stars. Now, Victoria Wilson gives us the most complete portrait of this magnificent actress, seen as the quintessential Brooklyn girl whose family was in fact of old New England stock…her years in New York as dancer and Broadway star…her fraught marriage to Broadway genius, Frank Fay…the adoption of a son; her partnership with Zeppo Marx, with whom she created a horse breeding farm; her fairytale romance and marriage to Robert Taylor, America's most sought-after male star… Here is the shaping of her career working with Hollywood's most important directors, all set against the times—the Depression, the rise of the unions, the coming of World War II, and a fast-evolving motion picture industry. At the heart of the book is Stanwyck herself—how she transformed herself from shunned outsider into one of America's most revered screen actresses. Volume One is the result of more than 100 exhaustive interviews with those who knew Stanwyck, many who never before had agreed to be interviewed: her family, friends, and co-workers from Lauren Bacall, Jane Fonda, and Jackie Cooper to Patricia Neal, Milton Berle, and Kirk Douglas; from Billy Wilder, Bruce Dern, and Anthony Quinn to Jane Powell, Charlton Heston, Arthur Laurents, and Sydney Lumet. “An epic Hollywood narrative,” A Life of Barbara Stanwyck includes never-before-seen letters, journals, and photographs.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IEnwCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Yet many still find it difficult to capture the collective intelligence of their employees and customers. Companies don't know what they know--but they need to learn soon. Thanks to a new class of collaborative technologies, organizations can now leverage information in valuable new ways, including: capturing accumulated knowledge; connecting employees who need information with the experts who have it; and enabling the best ideas to emerge organically. These technologies--labeled ""Web 2.0""--first appeared on the Internet, where they powered successful social communities and collaborative platforms like Facebook and Wikipedia. Web 2.0 tools, practices, and philosophies are now being deployed by a wide range of organizations, making them more agile, productive, and innovative. This is the phenomenon of Enterprise 2.0. In this compelling book, Andrew McAfee--a veteran researcher and writer on the business impact of technology, and the originator of the phrase ""Enterprise 2.0""describes the power of Enterprise 2.0 and shows readers how to harness it. McAfee weaves together case studies, discussions of technological change, and multidisciplinary research to: - Show how early adopters like Google, the BBC, and the CIA have profited from Enterprise 2.0 - Specify the concrete business benefits that arise when Web 2.0 technologies are properly deployed - Reveal where the real risks and roadblocks are with Enterprise 2.0, and why most concerns are unfounded - Guide companies through an Enterprise 2.0 deployment Enterprise 2.0 is written not for technology experts, but for pragmatic decision makers in any kind of organization.

Music, Education, and Religion: Intersections and Entanglements explores the critical role that religion can play in formal and informal music education. As in broader educational studies, research in music education has tended to sidestep the religious dimensions of teaching and learning, often reflecting common assumptions of secularity in contemporary schooling in many parts of the world. This book considers the ways in which the forces of religion and belief construct and complicate the values and practices of music education—including teacher education, curriculum texts, and teaching repertoires. The contributors to this volume embrace a range of perspectives from a variety of disciplines, examining religious, agnostic, skeptical, and atheistic points of view. Music, Education, and Religion is a valuable resource for all music teachers and scholars in related fields, interrogating the sociocultural and epistemological underpinnings of music repertoires and global educational practices. “The book serves as a study volume for all those who are active in this field and provides both systematic reflections and useful empirical studies.

Bringing together a group of leading scholars from Asia, Europe, Australia and North America, it discusses multiple issues regarding religious commodifications and their consequences across Asia’s diverse religious traditions. Covering key issues in the anthropology and sociology of contemporary Asian religion, it draws theoretical implications for the study of religions in the light of the shift of religious institutions from traditional religious beliefs to material prosperity. The fact that religions compete with each other in a ‘market of faiths’ is also at the core of the analysis. The contributions show how ordinary people and religious institutions in Asia adjusted to, and negotiated with, the penetrative forces of a global market economy into the region’s changing religio-cultural landscapes. An excellent contribution to the growing demands of ethnographically and theoretically updated interpretations of Asian religions, Religious Commodifications in Asia will be of interest to scholars of Asian religion and new religious movements.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R498AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It is now apparent that the modernization and nation-building projects of Asian states in that era have not only failed to subordinate religious authority to that of the state, but have created a crisis of authority that has led many people in these countries to turn to religious visions of authority other than those sanctioned by their states. The essays in this volume together make an important statement about the nature of Asian religions and societies in the late twentieth century, and demonstrate that, despite the modernization of East and Southeast Asia, religious activity has remained resilient and pervasive. As Jean Comaroff writes in her Epilogue to this work, ""... the 'religions of Asia' were often invoked as evidence for a global evolutionary scheme in which Europe emerged as the birthplace of secular reason, itself the sine qua non of modern life. Yet the present essays draw on Asian history and ethnography to assert... that religion and ritual are crucial in the life of 'modern' nations and communities, in Asia as elsewhere. They urge us, in collective voice, to distrust disenchantment, to rethink the telos of development that still informs the models of much mainstream social science."" The noted scholars contributing to this volume examine some of the tensions and conflicts between states and religious communities over the scope of religious views of the communities, the consequences of state-imposed definitions of religion, and the religious basis for resistance to state authority. These studies focus on Japan, Korea, the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Cambodia. A work of substantial and well-grounded scholarship, Asian Visions of Authority will be of great interest to specialists in East and Southeast Asia, to students of religion and society, and to both sociologists of religion and religious studies specialists in Asian traditions.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=crJCNLyCnPYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

This cogent, forcefully argued book presents a decidedly unpopular view —namely, that the central tenet of Christianity, the resurrection of Jesus, is false. The author asks a number of probing questions: Is the evidence about Jesus as it has been relayed to us over the centuries of sufficient quantity and quality to justify belief in the resurrection? How can we accept the resurrection but reject magic at the Salem witch trials? What light does contemporary research about human rationality from the fields of behavioral economics, empirical psychology, cognitive science, and philosophy shed on the resurrection and religious belief? Can we use contemporary research about the reliability of people’s beliefs in the supernatural, miracles, and the paranormal to shed light on the origins of Christianity and other religions? Does it make sense that the all-powerful creator of the universe would employ miracles to achieve his ends? Can a Christian believe by faith alone and yet reasonably deny the supernatural claims of other religions? Do the arguments against Christianity support atheism? By carefully answering each of these questions, this book undermines Christianity and theism at their foundations; it gives us a powerful model for better critical reasoning; and it builds a compelling case for atheism.

Adams persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document, [3] which Congress would edit to produce the final version.

Native Americans, the first foresters, periodically burned the undergrowth to improve hunting and to clear land for farming. Mississippi Forests and Forestry tells the story of human interaction with Mississippi's woodlands. With forty black-and-white images and extensive documentation, this history debunks long-held myths, such as the notion of the first settlers encountering ""virgin"" forests. Drawing on primary materials, government documents, newspapers, interviews, contemporary accounts, and secondary works, historian James E. Fickle describes an ongoing commerce between people and place, from Native American maintenance of the woods, to white exploration and settlement, to early economic activities in Mississippi's forests, to present-day conservation and responsible use. Viewed over time, issues of conservation are rarely one-sided. Mississippi Forests and Forestry describes how the rise of ""scientific"" forestry coincided with the efforts of some early lumber companies and industrial foresters to operate responsibly in harvesting trees and providing for reforestation. Surprisingly, the rise of the pulp and paper industry made reforestation possible in many parts of the state. Mississippi Forests and Forestry is a history of individuals as well as industries. The book looks closely at the ways the lumber industry operated in the woods and mills and at the living and working conditions of people in the industries. It argues that the early industrial foresters, some lumber companies, and pulp and paper manufacturers practiced utilitarian conservation. By the late 1950s, they accomplished what some considered a miracle. Mississippi's forests had been restored. With the rise of environmentalism in the 1960s, popular ideas concerning the proper management and use of forests changed. Practices such as clearcutting, single-age management, and manufacturing by chip mills became highly controversial. Looking ahead, Mississippi Forests and Forestry examines the issues that remain heated topics of conservation and use. James E. Fickle has been a professor of history at the University of Memphis since 1968. His previous books include The New South and the ""New Competition"" (University of Illinois Press, 1980).",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MOuc3wTN7_IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Yet many still find it difficult to capture the collective intelligence of their employees and customers. Companies don't know what they know--but they need to learn soon. Thanks to a new class of collaborative technologies, organizations can now leverage information in valuable new ways, including: capturing accumulated knowledge; connecting employees who need information with the experts who have it; and enabling the best ideas to emerge organically. These technologies--labeled ""Web 2.0""--first appeared on the Internet, where they powered successful social communities and collaborative platforms like Facebook and Wikipedia. Web 2.0 tools, practices, and philosophies are now being deployed by a wide range of organizations, making them more agile, productive, and innovative. This is the phenomenon of Enterprise 2.0. In this compelling book, Andrew McAfee--a veteran researcher and writer on the business impact of technology, and the originator of the phrase ""Enterprise 2.0""describes the power of Enterprise 2.0 and shows readers how to harness it. McAfee weaves together case studies, discussions of technological change, and multidisciplinary research to: - Show how early adopters like Google, the BBC, and the CIA have profited from Enterprise 2.0 - Specify the concrete business benefits that arise when Web 2.0 technologies are properly deployed - Reveal where the real risks and roadblocks are with Enterprise 2.0, and why most concerns are unfounded - Guide companies through an Enterprise 2.0 deployment Enterprise 2.0 is written not for technology experts, but for pragmatic decision makers in any kind of organization.

Many are called upon to rid the galaxy of lingering navigation data that could potentially reveal the location of Earth and ensure the destruction of humanity. Among those tasked with eliminating any trace of such dangerous information is Navy Lieutenant Jacob Keyes—now saddled with a top-secret mission by the Office of Naval Intelligence…one that will take him to a corner of the galaxy where nothing is as it seems. Out beyond the Outer Colonies lies the planet Hesiod, a gas giant surrounded by a vast asteroid belt. As the Covenant continues to glass the human-occupied planets near Hesiod, many of the survivors, aided by a stronghold of human insurrectionists, are fleeing to the asteroids for refuge. They have transformed the tumbling satellites into a tenuous yet ingenious settlement known as the Rubble—and have come face-to-face with a Covenant settlement of Kig-Yar…yet somehow survived.

The question of identity was to play a central role in the lives of these and later converts whether of Spanish or Portuguese heritage, for they could not return to Judaism as long as they remained on the Peninsula, and their place in the Christian world would never be secure. This book considers the history of the Iberian conversos-both those who remained in Spain and Portugal and those who emigrated. Wherever they resided the question of identity was inescapable. The exile who chose France or England, where Jews could not legally reside, was faced with different considerations and options than the converso who chose Holland, a newly formed Protestant country where Jews had not previously resided. Choosing Italy entailed a completely different set of options and dilemmas. Ren?e Levine Melammed compares and contrasts the lives of the New Christians of the Iberian Peninsula with those of these countries and the development of their identity and sense of ethnic solidarity with ""those of the Nation."" Exploring the knotty problem of identity she examines a great variety of individual choices and behaviors. Some conversos tried to be sincere Catholics and were not allowed to do so. Others tried but failed either theologically or culturally. While many eventually opted to form Jewish communities outside the Peninsula, others were unable to make a total commitment to Judaism and became ""cultural commuters"" who could and did move back and forth between two worlds whereas others had ""fuzzy"" or attenuated Jewish identities. In addition, the encounter with modernity by the descendants of conversos is examined in three communities, Majorca, Belmonte (Portugal) and the Southwestern United States, revealing that even today the question of identity is still a pressing issue. Offering the only broad historical survey of this fascinating and complex group of migrants, this book will appeal to a wide range of academic and general readers.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KnfI4c03lRQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The firm leased him a BMW, paid off his school loans, arranged a mortgage, and hired the McDeeres a decorator. Mitch should have remembered what his brother Ray—doing fifteen years in a Tennessee jail—already knew: You never get nothing for nothing. Now the FBI has the lowdown on Mitch’s firm and needs his help. Mitch is caught between a rock and a hard place, with no choice—if he wants to live.

Raymond Haberski's provocative and insightful book traces the trajectory of this evolution throughout the twentieth century, from nickelodeon amusements to the age of the financial blockbuster. Haberski begins by looking at the barriers to film's acceptance as an art form, including the Chicago Motion Picture Commission hearings of 1918–1920, one of the most revealing confrontations over the use of censorship in the motion picture industry. He then examines how movies overcame the stigma attached to popular entertainment through such watershed events as the creation of the Museum of Modern Art's Film Library in the 1920s. The arguments between Pauline Kael and Andrew Sarris's heralded a golden age of criticism, and Haberski focuses on the roles of Kael, Sarris, James Agee, Roger Ebert, and others, in the creation of ""cinephilia."" Described by Susan Sontag as ""born of the conviction that cinema was an art unlike any other,"" this love of cinema centered on coffee houses, universities, art theaters, film festivals, and, of course, foreign films. The lively debates over the place of movies in American culture began to wane in the 1970s. Haberski places the blame on the loss of cultural authority and on the increasing irrelevance of the meaning of art. He concludes with a persuasive call for the re-emergence of a middle ground between art and entertainment, ""something more complex, ambiguous, and vexing—something worth thought.""",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p0YoEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

For over a century, Churchill has been both praised and condemned for his role in launching this highly controversial campaign. For some, the Dardanelles offensive was a brilliant concept that might have dramatically shortened the First World War. To many others, however, Churchill was a reckless amateur who drove his unwilling and misinformed colleagues into a venture that was doomed to fail. This book, based on exhaustive archival research, provides a detailed and authoritative account of the Gallipoli campaign's origins and execution, stripping away the layers of myth that have long surrounded these dramatic events, and showing that no simple verdict is either possible or fair. Naval historian Christopher M. Bell untangles Churchill's complicated relationship with the dynamic First Sea Lord, Admiral Jacky Fisher, and reveals for the first time the behind-the-scenes machinations that led to Churchill's removal from office, including Fisher's covert campaign to undermine support for the Dardanelles operation, and the leaks by figures in high places that fuelled a bitter press campaign to drive Churchill from power. Equal attention is also given to the perhaps even more important story of Churchill and the Dardanelles after 1915. As Bell shows, Churchill spent a good deal of time and effort in the following two decades trying to refute his critics and convince the wider public that the campaign had in fact nearly succeeded. These efforts were so successful that the legacy of the Dardanelles did not stand in the way of Churchill becoming Prime Minister in May 1940--Provided by publisher.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bVkjDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

He shows how the transition to a more powerful national state was managed on political soil where self-government was not an indigenous crop. Morrisey considers the genesis of self-government in the political thought of the founding U.S. presidents, comparing their understanding of the term with that of President Abraham Lincoln and Confederate States of America President, Jefferson Davis. In this text Morrisey aptly demonstrates how the regime of the founders was replaced by a much more statist regime during the Civil War.

The conclusion is that the secular cannot be viewed as a successor to religion, or be seen as on the side of the rational.

Chairman Murphy. Good morning. We will now commence the rehearing of the Davis-Bacon Reform Act. I, in deference to my good friend and colleague, Mr. Stenholm, will submit my remarks for the record, about 35 minutes' worth, so that you may proceed, Charlie. We won't hold you up, I know you have another hearing to go to. [The prepared statement of Hon. Austin J. Murphy follows: ] Statement of Hon. Austin J. Murphy, a Representative in Congress from the State of Pennsylvania Once again we are here to take up the age old debate on reform of the Davis-Bacon Act. Even though dates and some people have changed, we are still seeking to reform this law in nearly the same manner that the House of Representatives has successfully accepted twice before. Similarly, the opponents of this historic Act are just as intent on repeal or emasculation of Federal prevailing wage law under the banner of budgetary restraint. The Committee on Education and Labor has had a longstanding commitment to our colleagues in the House to address the issue of reform of the Davis-Bacon Act. Once more we are renewing this commitment. Hopefully, we may see real reform enacted in this Congress. In the previous two Congresses, the Subcommittee on Labor Standards held several hearings on this issue to examine problems identified with the application of the Act to specific Federal construction projects as well as deficiencies in enforcement. We have again reviewed the record of those hearings and mark-ups, and I believe the bill before us, H.R. 1231, fairly and equitably addresses the varied concerns of all the interested parties. To those who, in good faith, have urged that the Davis-Bacon Act be updated, I believe that H.R. 1231 will be welcome news.

Believing that Milton has a vital message for the modern world, Whiting has abandoned the usual pattern for examining a poet—study of versification, meter, and other poetic devices. Instead, he presents an exposition of the spiritual and moral meaning of Milton’s poetry, which can still have truth and beauty for this doubting age. The literary image of the pendant world was familiar in Milton’s seventeenth century, but is meaningless to most people of our day. The comforting picture of the world hanging from heaven on a golden chain signifies God’s close watchfulness over humanity and the inseparable bond which links us to the spiritual kingdom. The author declares that the search for God and the struggle to overcome the spiritual and material forces that impede the search represent the most vital of all human efforts; for unless this search is our primary motivation, life is without meaning, without final purpose. Whiting also observes that true Christianity stands not for the impoverishment of humanity and our enslavement to the Deity, but rather for human moral health, harmonious development, and spiritual welfare. In order to save civilization from destruction at the hands of its friends—secularists, specialists, militarists, and politicians—we must have a renaissance of the spirit, a cultural synthesis in which a revitalized religion, enriched by philosophy and science, renews the ideals of Christianity.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A1xUCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Among the results obtained are: new criteria for convexity of Tchebycheff sets in terms of continuity properties of the metric projection operator; conditions on the character of integrability of a periodic function of several variables under which its Fourier series converges to it in measure; a characterization of representation systems for symmetric spaces in which there are no nonzero continuous functionals.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vbb8h89wWJEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

590,590,The Iron Age,,en,['Hardware'],,NOT_MATURE,,1890,,9781782976769,196.39,EUR,"Archaeology has long dealt with issues of identity, and especially with ethnicity, with modern approaches emphasising dynamic and fluid social construction. The archaeology of the Iron Age in particular has engendered much debate on the topic of ethnicity, fuelled by the first availability of written sources alongside the archaeological evidence which has led many researchers to associate the features they excavate with populations named by Greek or Latin writers. Some archaeological traditions have had their entire structure built around notions of ethnicity, around the relationships existing between large groups of people conceived together as forming unitary ethnic units. On the other hand, partly influenced by anthropological studies, other scholars have written forcefully against Iron Age ethnic constructions, such as the Celts. The 24 contributions to this volume focus on the south east Europe, where the Iron Age has, until recently, been populated with numerous ethnic groups with which specific material culture forms have been associated. The first section is devoted to the core geographical area of south east Europe: Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, as well as Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The following three sections allow comparison with regions further to the west and the south west with contributions on central and western Europe, the British Isles and the Italian peninsula. The volume concludes with four papers which provide more synthetic statements that cut across geographical boundaries, the final contributions bringing together some of the key themes of the volume. The wide array of approaches to identity presented here reflects the continuing debate on how to integrate material culture, protohistoric evidence (largely classical authors looking in on first millennium BC societies) and the impact of recent nationalistic agendas.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rYBiBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Each debate has four principal speakers: one to propose the motion, another to oppose it, and two seconders. The first debate addresses the disciplinary character of social anthropology: can it be regarded as a science, and if so, is it able to establish general propositions about human culture and social life? The second examines the concept of society, and in the third debate the spotlight is turned on the role of culture in people's perception of their environments. The fourth debate focuses on the place of language in the formation of culture. The fifth takes up the question of how we view the past in relation to the present. Finally, in the sixth debate, the concern is with the cross-cultural applicability of the concept of aesthetics. With its unique debate format, Key Debates in Anthropology addresses issues that are currently at the top of the theoretical agenda, which register the pulse of contemporary thinking in social anthropology.

Minnis develops a model of how tribal societies deal with severe food shortages. While focusing on the prehistory of the Rio Mimbres region of New Mexico, he provides comparative data from the Fringe Enga of New Guinea, the Tikopia of Tikopia Island, and the Gwembe Tonga of South Africa. Minnis proposes that, faced with the threat of food shortages, nonstratified societies survive by employing a series of responses that are increasingly effective but also are increasingly costly and demand increasingly larger cooperative efforts. The model Minnis develops allows him to infer, from evidence of such factors as population size, resource productivity, and climate change, the occurrence of food crises in the past. Using the Classic Mimbres society as a test case, he summarizes the regional archeological sequence and analyzes the effects of environmental fluctuations on economic and social organization. He concludes that the responses of the Mimbres people to their burgeoning population were inadequate to prevent the collapse of the society in the late twelfth century. In its illumination of the general issue of responses to food shortages, Social Adaptation to Food Stress will interest not only archeologists but also those concerned with current food shortages in the Third World. Cultural ecologists and human geographers will be able to derive a wealth of ideas, methods, and data from Minnis's work.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n89PquyTAzIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

What is karma? Most people understand karma as a balance sheet of good and bad deeds, virtues and sins. The mechanism that decrees that we cannot evade the consequences of our own actions. In reality, karma has nothing to do with reward and punishment. Karma simply means action: your action, your responsibility. It isn’t some external system of crime and punishment, but an internal cycle generated by you. Accumulation of karma is determined only by your intention and the way you respond to what is happening to you. Over time, it’s possible to become ensnared by your own unconscious patterns of behavior. In Karma, Sadhguru seeks to put you back in the driver’s seat, turning you from a terror-struck passenger to a confident driver navigating the course of your own destiny. By living consciously and fully inhabiting each moment, you can free yourself from the cycle. Karma is an exploration and a manual, restoring our understanding of karma to its original potential for freedom and empowerment instead of a source of entanglement. Through Sadhguru’s teachings, you will learn how to live intelligently and joyfully in a challenging world.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vcv0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Each mystery is exciting and dramatic, but it's the drama in Sammy's personal life that keeps readers coming back to see what happens next with her love interest Casey, her soap-star mother, and her mysterious father.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jJ1lukQoq_sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The first edition of Architect?, published in 1985, quickly became known as the best basic guide to the architectural profession. More than a decade later, it is a standard text for introductory courses on architecture and recommended reading on the application forms of many schools of architecture. This revised edition includes new information pertinent to current education and practice and addresses issues and concerns of great interest to students choosing among different types of programs, schools, firms, and architectural career paths. Roger K. Lewis, a practicing architect and educator, takes a hard look at the education of the architect as he covers such topics as curriculum content, pedagogical theories and methods, program and faculty types, the admission process, internship, compensation, computer-aided design, and the culture of small and large firms. He tells how an architect works and gets work, and explains all aspects of architectural services, from initial client contact to construction oversight. The author describes the benefits of becoming an architect, including the opportunity to express oneself creatively, to improve the environment, and to achieve notoriety. But he doesn't hesitate to show the other side—the lack of steady work and appropriate compensation, the intensity of competition, the restrictions imposed by clients, and the high degree of anxiety and disillusionment among young architects. Written in a clear, accessible style, the book is accompanied by the authors often-humorous illustrations and a valuable appendix.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TZ7uDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

This Louisiana presentation marks the first major retrospective exhibition of his work in Europe in over 60 years. The work of the American painter and poet Marsden Hartley (1877-1943) can be regarded as a bridge between European and American modernism. Hartley lived much of his life nomadically between Europe and the USA, and his travels produced a number of profoundly original groups of works from 1906 until 1943. Among these we can count a series of abstract paintings created with a point of departure in military symbols from the horrors of the First World War; desolate, almost surreal landscapes from New Mexico; feminized figure paintings of muscular working men.

As the Great Depression puts forty percent of the country out of work, people sell apples on the streets and comfortable living quarters are traded in for Hoovervilles. Life in the colored section of Woodmere, Georgia reaches rock bottom. RayMyra and Elaine Elliott are sisters. The differences between them is as stark as their skin color. RayMyra, described as Alight bright, almost white,@ leaves their home town for New York City. Passing for white, she marries a South African diamond mine owner, and straddles two worlds, but finds it difficult being a part-time Negro. Elaine, a Ahigh-yella gal@runs away from a love triangle and heads for the stages of Hollywood. Along the way to fame and fortune, she encounters the low-lifes of the road, losing everything she owns, and making her home in a corrugated Kellogg Corn Flakes box. Called Aunt Ella by everyone, the sixty-two year old matriarch has withstood the loss of her children to war, accident, and lynching. Having a life long prejudiced against whites, she takes it upon her shoulders to leave a mark on the world. May Lee, a high school friend of RaeMyra and Elaine with six children and no husband, remains in Bottoms, Georgia, a district south of Atlanta. Making figurines that are not much more than broken glass and glue, and never believing life would give her anything except more children, she and Aunt Ella rebuild both the town and faith in their fellow man. RaeMyra, Elaine, Aunt Ella and May Lee have nothing in common and everything in common. They share friendship, bloodlines and the staunch determination to survive whatever life throws at them. With nowhere to go but up, they reach inside themselves and find the strength to survive just one more day. Joy Road is as thought provoking as the four women who bring it to life. Intensely emotional, Shirley Hailstock=s novel explores the depths of family love, showing that time, distance, and life=s decisions don=t break the bonds of kinship.

Sometimes the largest blaze begins with the tiniest spark. At the dawn of the twentieth century, William J. Seymour, the son of Louisiana slaves, began meeting with a tiny congregation in a two-story wooden building in downtown Los Angeles. What began as a spontaneous gathering of believers quickly grew into a passionate revival and renewal of the work of the Holy Spirit. The movement spread at breathtaking speed. With little more than a printing press, a trolley stop, and a powerful message, the spiritual fire emanating from the Apostolic Faith Mission on Azusa Street rapidly crossed strict cultural and national borders—into Mexico, Canada, Britain, Scandinavia, Africa, India, and China. Led by William J. Seymour, the revival became the catalyst for the modern Pentecostal movement. Today, the more than 500 million Christians who identify as Pentecostal or Charismatic can trace the roots of their faith to this humble beginning at Azusa Street. The Azusa Street Mission and Revival tells the full story of how this uniquely diverse and inclusive group grew into a powerful movement that forever changed the landscape of Christianity.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JDiLDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Female Threat in Cain's ""Double Indemnity""",['Stephan Riedl'],en,['Literary Criticism'],,NOT_MATURE,GRIN Verlag,2017-05-23,17.0,9783668452305,-1.0,Not for sale,"Seminar paper from the year 2016 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, grade: 2,0, University of Koblenz-Landau, language: English, abstract: ""Double Indemnity"" was first published in 1935 and affirmed James M. Cain’s status as a novelist. By reading it, one can learn why, but that is not the only observation that can be made. It is noticeable that Phyllis, the Femme Fatale of the story, constantly oversteps the boundaries of her gender, thus posing a threat to men. The question that started this Term Paper was: How much of a threat to patriarchal masculinity is Phyllis and is this threat contained? The thesis is that Phyllis subverts patriarchal masculinity in two spheres, the business sphere and the domestic sphere and by doing this, threatens it. The goal is to look at several instances where she does it and deduct if the threat she poses is contained or not. In order to prove this thesis, a very short overview of the concept of sex and gender will be given which is a basic concept in cultural studies and needed when moving on to discuss masculinity during the 1930s. This will be followed by a look at the term hard-boiled fiction as it was perceived back then and the main character and the femme fatale of said genre. The literary analysis consists of a look at the world itself by using Huff’s casino metaphor, a closer look at Phyllis’s and Mr. Nirdlinger’s relationship, concluded with Phyllis’s motivation. Based on the theory and the analysis, it will be discussed if the female threat is contained or not and an outlook will be given.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nqUlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The field of human motivation is rapidly growing but most studies have focused on the effects of motivation on individuals' personal happiness and task engagement. Only recently have theorists and empiricists begun to recognize that dispositional and state motivations impact the ways individuals approach interpersonal interactions. In addition, researchers are now recognizing that the quality of interpersonal interactions influences consequent happiness and task engagement, thus helping to explain previous findings to this end. Similarly social psychology and relationships researchers have focused on the impact of cognitions, emotions, and behaviors on people's relationships. In their work, relationships researchers demonstrate that both contextual characteristics and individual differences influence the quality of interactions. Many of these studies seek to understand which characteristics strengthen the bonds between people, encourage empathy and trust and create a sense of well-being after a close interaction. This work seeks to integrate the field of human motivation and interpersonal relationships. Both fields have seen extensive growth in the past decade and each can contribute to the other. However, no single compiled work is available that targets both fields. This is the case, in part because only now is there enough work to make a strong and compelling case for their integration. In the previous years, research has been conducted to show that motivation is relevant and important for interactions among strangers and in close relationships. In addition developmental mechanisms for these relations are identified and mechanisms by which motivation strengthens people's relationships. Finally recent work has demonstrated the many implications for interpersonal relationships, showing that motivation impacts a range of interpersonal processes from prejudice regulation and objectification of others to empathy and care. This book seeks to summarize and organize all these findings and present them in a way that is relevant to both motivation researchers and social and relationship researchers.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0I_FBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

And after his not-so-distinguished client stepped down, Ben found himself appointed to complete the sullied senator’s term. Now, having barely gotten his political sea legs, he must rise to yet another challenge: advising the president’s next Supreme Court nominee during the sometimes thorny confirmation process. Luckily, Judge Thaddeus Roush’s popularity on both sides of the aisle looks to make him a shoo-in. Until he decides to out himself on national television–igniting a Beltway uproar and setting the stage for a bare-knuckle partisan brawl. Forced to scramble for spin control, Ben hastily calls a press conference for the now controversial candidate. But the photo op becomes a tabloid nightmare when, on live TV, a brutally murdered woman is discovered in the judge’s backyard. For the political forces out to torpedo the nomination of a gay Supreme Court Justice, the shocking turn of events is pure gold. With the secret backing of the president and a made-to-order new candidate waiting in the wings, the cagey senate majority leader and his most ruthless allies mount a smear campaign that would put Joe McCarthy to shame. But Team Kincaid isn’t about to let the best man for the job get derailed. While Ben uses his best courtroom strategies to wage a war of words, his crack private eye, Loving, hits the capital streets to fight a much more hands-on battle–with hustlers, hit men, and homicidal hoods–as he digs for dirt in places even Deep Throat would avoid. It’s soon clear that this game is anything but politics as usual. In Capitol Threat, William Bernhardt serves up a resounding one-two punch of political intrigue and legal suspense peppered with a volley of his trademark plot twists, sly wit, and persistent thrills.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6gd-Z1VEZc4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Wilkins explores the essentialist view, a staple of logic from Plato and Aristotle through the Middle Ages to fairly recent times, and considers the idea of species in natural history—a concept often connected to reproduction. Tracing ""generative conceptions"" of species back through Darwin to Epicurus, Wilkins provides a new perspective on the relationship between philosophical and biological approaches to this concept. He also reviews the array of current definitions.

Without it, geology would be but a fragmentary science, a science of the structure of the earth only. By the aid of fossils, the succes sion of rocks, their distribution and relations are determined. They are the key which unlocks the most difficult problems of stratification. Upon them the seeker after the economic sub stances of the earth must mainly depend. Until the paleon tologist has deciphered the records, the geologist can only grope blindly. The study of fossils, then, needs no apology from the economist. As a pure science paleontology is inextricably united with the science of biology, the science of living things; as an applied science, it is equally intimately related to the structure and history of the earth. In the tracing of the rocks' strata, physical characters are often deceptive and unreliable; paleontological characters are decisive and incontrovertible. Kansas has long been a famous region for the paleontologist. Perhaps no equal area in the United States presents such varied and remarkable fossil records as does Kansas. The fame of her fossils is world-wide. The pages she has added to the geo logical history of the earth are already classic. But, while the state has furnished so much of interest and of value to the sciences of geology and paleontology, the published accounts, what there are of them, have been accessible only to the specialist in scattered and abstruse papers.

Exploring how erotic love is represented in ancient amatory literature, Konstan points to the symmetry in the passion of the hero and heroine as a unique feature of the Greek novel: they fall mutually in love, they are of approximately the same age and social class, and their reciprocal attachment ends in marriage. He shows how the plots of the novels are perfectly adapted to expressing this symmetry and how, because of their structure, they differ from classical epic, elegy, comedy, tragedy, and other genres, including modern novels ranging from Sidney to Harlequin romances. Using works like Chaereas and Callirhoe and Daphnis and Chloe, Konstan examines such issues as pederasty, the role of eros in both marital and nonmarital love, and the ancient Greek concept of fidelity. He reveals how the novelistic formula of sexual symmetry reverses the pattern of all other ancient genres, where erotic desire appears one-sided and unequal and is often viewed as either a weakness or an aggressive, conquering power. Konstan's approach draws upon theories concerning the nature of sexuality in the ancient world, reflected in the work of Michel Foucault, David Halperin, and John Winkler.

It discusses the use of the molecular symmetry group, whose elements consist of permutations of identical nuclei with or without inversion. After reviewing the permutation groups, inversion operation, point groups, and representation of groups, the book describes the use of representations for labeling molecular energy. The text explains an approximate time independent Schrödinger equation for a molecule, as well as the effect of a nuclear permutation or the inversion of E* on such equation. The book also examines the expression for the complete molecular Hamiltonian and the several groups of operations commuting with the Hamiltonian. The energy levels of the Hamiltonian can then be symmetrically labeled by the investigator using the irreducible representations of these groups. The text explains the two techniques to change coordinates in a Schrödinger equation, namely, (1) by using a diatomic molecule in the rovibronic Schrödinger equation, and (2) by a rigid nonlinear polyatomic molecule. The book also explains that using true symmetry, basis symmetry, near symmetry, and near quantum numbers, the investigator can label molecular energy levels.

The models are handled either in discrete time (DT) or in continuous time (CT). Physical systems give rise to models only in CT because they are based on physical laws which are invariably in CT. In system identification, indirect methods provide DT models which are then converted into CT. Methods of directly identifying CT models are preferred to the indirect methods for various reasons. The direct methods involve a primary stage of signal processing, followed by a secondary stage of parameter estimation. In the primary stage, the measured signals are processed by a general linear dynamic operation—computational or realized through prefilters, to preserve the system parameters in their native CT form—and the literature is rich on this aspect. In this book: Identification of Continuous-Time Systems-Linear and Robust Parameter Estimation, Allamaraju Subrahmanyam and Ganti Prasada Rao consider CT system models that are linear in their unknown parameters and propose robust methods of estimation. This book complements the existing literature on the identification of CT systems by enhancing the secondary stage through linear and robust estimation. In this book, the authors provide an overview of CT system identification, consider Markov-parameter models and time-moment models as simple linear-in-parameters models for CT system identification, bring them into mainstream model parameterization via basis functions, present a methodology to robustify the recursive least squares algorithm for parameter estimation of linear regression models, suggest a simple off-line error quantification scheme to show that it is possible to quantify error even in the absence of informative priors, and indicate some directions for further research.

Dana Luciano argues that the cultural plotting of grief provides a distinctive insight into the nineteenth-century American temporal imaginary, since grief both underwrote the social arrangements that supported the nation’s standard chronologies and sponsored other ways of advancing history. Nineteenth-century appeals to grief, as Luciano demonstrates, diffused modes of “sacred time” across both religious and ostensibly secular frameworks, at once authorizing and unsettling established schemes of connection to the past and the future. Examining mourning manuals, sermons, memorial tracts, poetry, and fiction by Harriet Beecher Stowe, William Apess, James Fenimore Cooper, Catharine Maria Sedgwick, Susan Warner, Harriet E. Wilson, Herman Melville, Frances E. W. Harper, Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, Elizabeth Keckley, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, Luciano illustrates the ways that grief coupled the affective body to time. Drawing on formalist, Foucauldian, and psychoanalytic criticism, Arranging Grief shows how literary engagements with grief put forth ways of challenging deep-seated cultural assumptions about history, progress, bodies, and behaviors.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XjihBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Instead it demonstrates that it is specific to individuals and will only increase if employee perceptions are improved. Readers will discover how the PACE process model can be used to maximise employee engagement through the modification of primary causal factors, and consequently generate direct outputs such as increased productivity and reduced absenteeism.

Last night, someone followed Sammy up the fire escape and pushed her from the third story. Now she’s in the hospital, out cold. And her friends are left with the questions Sammy’s always been so good at answering: Why? How? But most of all . . . WHO? In this emotional conclusion to her beloved long-running series, Wendelin Van Draanen shows just how many lives one nosy girl can touch and pays tribute to a life well sleuthed. Praise for Sammy Keyes: “If Kinsey Millhone ever hires a junior partner, Sammy Keyes will be the first candidate on the list. She’s feisty, fearless, and funny. A top-notch investigator!” —Sue Grafton “Sammy’s brave, resourceful, observant and a loyal friend, but this girl sleuth is no well-mannered Nancy Drew. She’s endearingly hot-tempered, nosy, and not always obedient—in short, she’s someone I want to read about again.” —Margaret Maron",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=__2MEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Brenner's Encyclopedia of Genetics, Second Edition, builds on the foundation of the first edition by addressing many of the key subfields of genetics that were just in their infancy when the first edition was published. The currency and accessibility of this foundational content will be unrivalled, making this work useful for scientists and non-scientists alike. Featuring relatively short entries on genetics topics written by experts in that topic, Brenner's Encyclopedia of Genetics provides an effective way to quickly learn about any aspect of genetics, from Abortive Transduction to Zygotes. Adding to its utility, the work provides short entries that briefly define key terms, and a guide to additional reading and relevant websites for further study. Many of the entries include figures to explain difficult concepts. Key terms in related areas such as biochemistry, cell, and molecular biology are also included, and there are entries that describe historical figures in genetics, providing insights into their careers and discoveries. This 7-volume set represents a 25% expansion from the first edition, with over 1600 articles encompassing this burgeoning field. Thoroughly up-to-date, with many new topics and subfields covered that were in their infancy or not inexistence at the time of the first edition. Timely coverage of emergent areas such as epigenetics, personalized genomic medicine, pharmacogenetics, and genetic enhancement technologies Interdisciplinary and global in its outlook, as befits the field of genetics Brief articles, written by experts in the field, which not only discuss, define, and explain key elements of the field, but also provide definition of key terms, suggestions for further reading, and biographical sketches of the key people in the history of genetics.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4cj64BhrnjcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

In a searching analysis, Elizabeth Ettorre uncovers the hidden social processes involved in the development of these technologies. Focussing on prenatal screening, she explores how the key concepts of gender and the body are intertwined with the process of building genetic knowledge and some of the unintended consequences for women. These include the injection of biology into social relationships and the development of a gendered discourse of shame and stigmatisation in which the perfect body becomes idealised and new conceptions of disability are shaped. It becomes clear that the modernist tradition of scientific disinterestedness is being replaced by a new ethic: the making of moral judgements by scientists. Reproductive Genetics, Gender and the Body draws on interviews with European medical, legal and nursing professionals and raises important issues around the gendered, female body, the site of genetic capital.

Mexican Americans and the Law illustrates how Mexican Americans have played crucial roles in mounting legal challenges regarding issues that directly affect their political, educational, and socioeconomic status. Each chapter highlights historical contexts, relevant laws, and policy concerns for a specific issue and features abridged versions of significant state and federal cases involving Mexican Americans. Beginning with People v. Zammora (1940), the trial that was a precursor to the Zoot Suit Riots in Los Angeles during World War II, the authors lead students through some of the most important and precedent-setting cases in American law: - Educational equality: from segregation concerns in MŽndez v. Westminster (1946) to unequal funding in San Antonio Independent School District vs. Rodr’guez (1973) - Gender issues: reproductive rights in Madrigal v. Quilligan (1981), workplace discrimination in EEOC v. Hacienda Hotel (1989), sexual violence in Aguirre-Cervantes v. INS (2001) - Language rights: _–iguez v. Arizonans for Official English (1995), Garc’a v. Gloor (1980), Serna v. Portales Municipal Schools (1974) - Immigration-: search and seizure questions in U.S. v. Brignoni-Ponce (1975) and U.S. v. Mart’nez-Fuerte (1976); public benefits issues in Plyler v. Doe (1982) and League of United Latin American Citizens v. Wilson (1997) - Voting rights: redistricting in White v.

Activists like Jesús Cruz, and later Ralph Cuarón, sought justice for miserable working conditions and the poor treatment of Mexican Americans and immigrants through protests and sit-ins. Lesser known is the influence that Communism and socialism had on the early roots of the Chicano Movement, a legacy that continues today. Examining the role of Mexican American working-class and radical labor activism in American history, Enrique M. Buelna focuses on the work of the radical Left, particularly the Communist Party (CP) USA. Buelna delves into the experiences of Cuarón, in particular, as well as those of his family. He writes about the family’s migration from Mexico; work in the mines in Morenci, Arizona; move to Los Angeles during the Great Depression; service in World War II; and experiences during the Cold War as a background to exploring the experiences of many Mexican Americans during this time period. The author follows the thread of radical activism and the depth of its influence on Mexican Americans struggling to achieve social justice and equality. The legacy of Cuarón and his comrades is significant to the Chicano Movement and in understanding the development of the labor and civil rights movements in the United States. Their contributions, in particular during the 1960s and 1970s, informed a new generation to demand an end to the Vietnam War and to expose educational inequality, poverty, civil rights abuses, and police brutality.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c-GMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Scott, the compelling tale of Asian peoples who until recently have stemmed the vast tide of state-making to live at arm’s length from any organized state society For two thousand years the disparate groups that now reside in Zomia (a mountainous region the size of Europe that consists of portions of seven Asian countries) have fled the projects of the organized state societies that surround them—slavery, conscription, taxes, corvée labor, epidemics, and warfare. This book, essentially an “anarchist history,” is the first-ever examination of the huge literature on state-making whose author evaluates why people would deliberately and reactively remain stateless. Among the strategies employed by the people of Zomia to remain stateless are physical dispersion in rugged terrain; agricultural practices that enhance mobility; pliable ethnic identities; devotion to prophetic, millenarian leaders; and maintenance of a largely oral culture that allows them to reinvent their histories and genealogies as they move between and around states. In accessible language, James Scott, recognized worldwide as an eminent authority in Southeast Asian, peasant, and agrarian studies, tells the story of the peoples of Zomia and their unlikely odyssey in search of self-determination. He redefines our views on Asian politics, history, demographics, and even our fundamental ideas about what constitutes civilization, and challenges us with a radically different approach to history that presents events from the perspective of stateless peoples and redefines state-making as a form of “internal colonialism.” This new perspective requires a radical reevaluation of the civilizational narratives of the lowland states. Scott’s work on Zomia represents a new way to think of area studies that will be applicable to other runaway, fugitive, and marooned communities, be they Gypsies, Cossacks, tribes fleeing slave raiders, Marsh Arabs, or San-Bushmen.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oiLYu2-uc8IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Based on the author's years of clinical experience treating addiction, the book posits a human psyche made up of three zones of awareness. The first two are reached by present-day psychology, focusing on cognitive and affective disorders, and therapies that treat addictive disorders. The crucial third zone, called Tertiary Awareness, is the 'rudder' of the human personality that contains deep bio- and eco-wisdoms that must be brought to consciousness and cultivated.

Sarah Rivett demonstrates that, instead, empiricism and natural philosophy combined with Puritanism to transform the scope of religious activity in colonial New England from the 1630s to the Great Awakening of the 1740s. In an unprecedented move, Puritan ministers from Thomas Shepard and John Eliot to Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards studied the human soul using the same systematic methods that philosophers applied to the study of nature. In particular, they considered the testimonies of tortured adolescent girls at the center of the Salem witch trials, Native American converts, and dying women as a source of material insight into the divine. Conversions and deathbed speeches were thus scrutinized for evidence of grace in a way that bridged the material and the spiritual, the visible and the invisible, the worldly and the divine. In this way, the ""science of the soul"" was as much a part of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century natural philosophy as it was part of post-Reformation theology.

With an aim of reframing questions of religious modernity, each chapter offers a new perspective on the phenomenon of spiritual seeking in Thailand.

I wish it had been given to every entrepreneur who appeared before me on Dragon's Den."";Doug Richard, Dragon on Dragon's Den "";Mullins' New Business Road Test provides the entrepreneurial equivalent to the proverbial 'sleeping policeman' on the Sunday drive: the necessary jolt of reality for those hanging on to the belief that value is created on a computer spreadsheet or a fancy PowerPoint presentation. The business plan is the road map between idea and sustainable business, and John offers the most valuable journey planner available."";Benoit Leleux, Professor of Entrepreneurship & Finance, IMD, Lausanne, Switzerland "";We work with hundreds of CEOs reviewing their investor pitches. The truth is that all businesses, even those already funded, can improve their business models and their road show presentation to investors or strategic partners. Good entrepreneurs understand that their emerging business remains 'work in progress'. Even on the road, they work the map. We recommend that all new entrepreneurs look at John's excellent new business road maps before hitting the ground."";William Stevens, E-Unlimited Got an idea for a new business? Take it for a road test to make sure it works before you invest valuable time and money in it. Most new businesses fail. Why?

The new edition of this best-selling book will help you to road test your idea, making sure that the business you build is based on a winning concept. It will enable you to invest your time and money wisely and pitch to investors and customers with confidence.

Under the categories of Promotion, Product and Place, contributors to the volume examine the strategies in the presentation of retail goods and environments that range from print advertising to product design to store display and architecture.

The sound was a predictable comfort. Like the sounds of the Corner Boys, a mildly delinquent lot consumed with pilfering Kool cigarettes or the feel of a virgin girl's behind. . . . As she did in her previous novels Tumbling and Blues Dancing, Diane McKinney-Whetstone once again masterfully renders time and place, character and emotional intensities. It is 1969 and Cecil Street is ""feeling some kind of way,"" so the residents decide to have two block parties this year. These energetic, sensual street celebrations serve as backdrops to the stories of the people on the block. Joe, a long-ago sax player, has turned his eye across the street to a newly arrived young southern beauty even as he is suddenly haunted by memories of his horn-playing nights and his affection for a shy, soft hooker from years ago. Joe's wife, Louise, a licensed practical nurse, is losing her teeth to gum disease and her joy to sensing that Joe's attention has wandered. Their teenage daughter, Shay, is consumed with helping her best friend and next-door neighbor Neet, who has gotten pregnant by a Corner Boy. Neet's mother, Alberta, is shunned by the block because of her immersion in a religion that has no name. As the novel opens, the first block party has ended and a naked woman has secretly taken up residence in Joe and Louise's cellar. McKinney-Whetstone's superb gift for language and storytelling, for crafting scenes that leave the reader breathless, for distilling complex human emotion in a well-turned phrase, is on full display here. She portrays the community and the times with precision and compassion in an unforgettable story that gets under the skin. As the novel builds to the second block party, the past becomes as immediate as the present, condemnable acts become righteous, and what is tragic is also filled with hope. This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y-HGwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Meanwhile, people with important ideas—entrepreneurs, teachers, politicians, and journalists—struggle to make them “stick.” In Made to Stick, Chip and Dan Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the human scale principle, using the Velcro Theory of Memory, and creating curiosity gaps. Along the way, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds—from the infamous “kidney theft ring” hoax to a coach’s lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony—draw their power from the same six traits. Made to Stick will transform the way you communicate. It’s a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures): the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of the Mother Teresa Effect; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice. Provocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, Made to Stick shows us the vital principles of winning ideas—and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7XGPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

When the sisters are forced to enter the City by very different means they risk being separated forever. Cloned Neandertal officer, Shuqba is exiled to a security outpost in the Demi-Settlements when she fails to adhere to the impossible standards set for her species within the City.

Yet many still find it difficult to capture the collective intelligence of their employees and customers. Companies don't know what they know--but they need to learn soon. Thanks to a new class of collaborative technologies, organizations can now leverage information in valuable new ways, including: capturing accumulated knowledge; connecting employees who need information with the experts who have it; and enabling the best ideas to emerge organically. These technologies--labeled ""Web 2.0""--first appeared on the Internet, where they powered successful social communities and collaborative platforms like Facebook and Wikipedia. Web 2.0 tools, practices, and philosophies are now being deployed by a wide range of organizations, making them more agile, productive, and innovative. This is the phenomenon of Enterprise 2.0. In this compelling book, Andrew McAfee--a veteran researcher and writer on the business impact of technology, and the originator of the phrase ""Enterprise 2.0""describes the power of Enterprise 2.0 and shows readers how to harness it. McAfee weaves together case studies, discussions of technological change, and multidisciplinary research to: - Show how early adopters like Google, the BBC, and the CIA have profited from Enterprise 2.0 - Specify the concrete business benefits that arise when Web 2.0 technologies are properly deployed - Reveal where the real risks and roadblocks are with Enterprise 2.0, and why most concerns are unfounded - Guide companies through an Enterprise 2.0 deployment Enterprise 2.0 is written not for technology experts, but for pragmatic decision makers in any kind of organization. Dispensing with hype, it takes a practical look at the competitive challenges facing so many organizations today and explores how they can be met and conquered with the right combination of novel technologies and enlightened leadership.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gqz3UF5FbI0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

With Android, you can do almost any computing task you can imagine. There are more than 400,000 Android applications (apps) to choose from. The majority of the apps are games and leisure programs. However, today there are also apps for practically any type of office work and business tasks that you can imagine. Many office tasks, which until recently could only be performed using a powerful PC or laptop, can today easily be done using an Android tablet or smartphone. There are several excellent Android apps for word processing and spreadsheet calculations so that these and many other types of office work easily can be done on handheld Android device. This has led to a new way of working, which is often called mobile computing. There are many excellent brands of Android tablets and smartphones on the market. Samsung is today seen as the leading manufacturer of Android smartphones and tablets. In 2010, Samsung launched the Galaxy Tab 7.1 tablet. The Galaxy Tab 7.1 quickly became highly popular and a benchmark for other Android tablets. Later, more powerful and larger Galaxy tabs have been marketed, including the Galaxy Tab 7.7, 8.9, and 10.1. This book focuses on the Galaxy Tab 7.1. You will benefit most from the book if you have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.1. If you own another tablet or smartphone running on Android 2.2 (Froyo) or 2.3 (Gingerbread), you will also benefit from reading the book, as the different brands of Android 2.2./2.3 tablets and smartphones work much in the same way. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.1 tablet is ideal for Android mobile office computing due to its excellent communication capabilities and size. It has highly effective and versatile built-in chipsets and tools for mobile (cellular) data communication, Wi-Fi network connections, and Bluetooth communication. In addition, its GPS antenna and tools make accurate location determination and navigation possible. It fits easily into any briefcase - and even into a large pocket, making it very easy carry around. The main challenge of mobile computing is possibly to get online in different situations - in a way that is inexpensive, secure, and effective. While both mobile (cellular) broadband and public Wi-Fi networks are rapidly being expanded and improved, it may still now and then be difficult or expensive to connect, when you are outside your carrier's coverage. If you can find a fast and inexpensive connection, it may not be secure. In this book, you get the needed technical background to make it easier for you to get online in an affordable and secure way, wherever you are. You get detailed information about mobile computing using mobile broadband (cellular) networks and Wi-Fi connections. You are introduced to the mobile connection standards 2G, 3G, and 4G.

890,890,Holstein Friesian Register,,en,['Cattle'],,NOT_MATURE,,1906,,1333231725,0.0,Free,"Excerpt from Outlines of the Advanced Registry System of the Holstein-Friesian Association of America: And Rules for Officially Authenticated Butter Fat Tests The first association of breeders of these cattle was formed in 1871, the first herd-book being published the following year. The present holstein-friesian Association was formed in 1885 by the union of two earlier associations, and is now the largest association of breeders of pure-bred dairy cattle in the world. Frederick L. Houghton, Brattleboro, Vt., has long been the able secretary of the association, and Wing R. Smith, Syracuse, N. Y., its trusted treasurer. Mr. S. Hoxie, the veteran superintendent of Advanced Registry, retired June 7, 1905, on account of age and ill health, at which time he was succeeded by the writer. How many holstein-friesian cattle there are now living is unknown; but since the juncture of the two old associations in 1885, to November 1, 1907, females and males have been recorded. The holstein-friesian Advanced Register, based for entry upon individual merit, was established in 1885; since which time eighteen volumes have been published and the nineteenth begun, containing entries of nearly cows and 533 bulls. The age of any female is computed as that at the time of last calving or aborting, and the require ments for entry vary with the age; being not less than pounds butter fat in seven consecutive days for a heifer calving at just two years of age or younger, and increasing proportionately to not less than 12 pounds butter fat for a cow calving at five years old, there being no increased requirements for increased age after a cow reaches the age of five years. Only bulls having four or more daughters which have been entered in the Advanced Register on official records of butter fat are accepted for entry. The rules for the entry of cows.in the holstein-friesian Advanced Register are very stringent, being designed to place every Holstein - Friesian record beyond even a shadow of a doubt. Every milking during the period of test must be watched, weighed, sampled and tested. By a representative of some State Agricultural College; and thus, because of resulting expense, the bulk of its records are for short periods, largely for one week. It will be readily admitted that eighteen pounds of butter fat will make twenty - one pounds of the best commercial butter, or an average of three pounds of butter per day when eighteen pounds of fat is produced in seven consecutive days, and that almost no cows other than holstein-friesian have ever, under strict rules, produced such an amount. The records of the holstein-friesian Advanced Register show that 324 cows have produced officially in excess. Of eighteen pounds butter fat in seven consecutive days; of which 122 cows have produced between eighteen and nineteen pounds, eighty-three cows between nineteen and twenty pounds, sixty-three cows between twenty and twenty-one pounds, twenty - three cows between twenty-one and twenty-two pounds, sixteen cows between twentytwo and twenty-three pounds, nine cows between twenty-three and twenty-four pound-s, three cows between twenty-four and twenty-five pounds, three cows between twenty-five and twenty-six pounds, one cow between twenty-seven and twenty-eight pounds, and one cow over twenty-eight pounds. It must be remembered that while many of these records were made by cows much under five years of age, there were large numbers of records made by two and three year-old heifers which were, considering age, proportionately as large, yet fell short of the eighteen-pound minimum required for this list.

The first work to bring a systematic and sophisticated criminological perspective to bear on crime films, Rafter and Brown's book provides a fresh way of looking at cinema, using the concepts and analytical tools of criminology to uncover previously unnoticed meanings in film, ultimately making the study of criminological theory more engaging and effective for students while simultaneously demonstrating how theories of crime circulate in our mass-mediated worlds.

Focusing on the evolvement of cinematic narratives, aesthetics, and techniques, the author balances a deep reading of the multiple filmic plots with a discussion of the cinematic portrayals of gender, romance, identities and power relations. Nuancing the prototypical cinematic form and tragic sense of classical film noir, the recent Hong Kong cinema turns around the classical generic role of film noir at the turn of the century to convey very different messages—joy, hope or love. This book examines how the mainstream cinema, or pre-and-post-Hong Kong cinema in particular, applies a peculiar strategy that makes rooms for the audience to enjoy a pleasure-giving process of reflexivity and also critique the mainstream ideology. With new analytical approaches and angles, this book breaks new ground in offering transcultural and cross-genre analyses on the cinema and its impact in local and international markets. This book is the first major scholarly investigation of the historical development and contemporary transformation of film noir in today’s Hong Kong. Focusing on the evolvement of cinematic narratives, aesthetics, and techniques, the author balances a deep reading of the multiple filmic plots with a refreshing discussion of the cinematic portrayals of gender, romance, identities and power relations.

First off are pictures like ""The Crowd"" and ""Applause"" that achieve rave reviews and even go on to win awards, but don't recover their negative costs. Then there are the movies the critics hate, but the public enjoys. All three versions of ""Back Street"", for instance. Finally come the pictures everyone loves, like ""From Here To Eternity"" or ""Sunset Boulevard"". In the annals of success in Hollywood's Golden Age, one name stands out above all others: Cecil B. DeMille. His famous pictures reviewed here include both versions of ""The Buccaneer"", ""The Crusades"", ""Sign of the Cross"", ""The Story of Dr Wassell"" and ""Union Pacific"". But the book also notes a DeMille ""B"" movie that tied up a fair amount of money but proved so unpopular it was released in some territories as a support.

While weatherly predictability and surprise can impact our daily experience, the history of cinema attests to the stylistic and narrative significance of snow, rain, wind, sunshine, clouds, and skies. Through analysis of films ranging from The Wizard of Oz to The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, from Citizen Kane to In the Mood for Love, Kristi McKim calls our attention to the ways that we read our atmospheres both within and beyond the movies. Building upon meteorological definitions of weather's dynamism and volatility, this book shows how film weather can reveal character interiority, accelerate plot development, inspire stylistic innovation, comprise a momentary attraction, convey the passage of time, and idealize the world at its greatest meaning-making capacity (unlike our weather, film weather always happens on time, whether for tumultuous, romantic, violent, suspenseful, or melodramatic ends). Akin to cinema's structuring of ephemera, cinematic weather suggests aesthetic control over what is fleeting, contingent, wildly environmental, and beyond human capacity to tame. This first book-length study of such a meteorological and cinematic affinity casts film weather as a means of artfully and mechanically conquering contingency through contingency, of taming weather through a medium itself ephemeral and enduring. Using film theory, history, formalist/phenomenological analysis, and eco-criticism, this book casts cinema as weather, insofar as our skies and screens become readable through our interpretation of changing phenomena.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZRrxQkqrFaQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It is past of a sweeping three-volume description of how management in some forty industries embraced the computer and changed the American economy. Computers have fundamentally changed the nature of work in America. However it is difficult to grasp the full extent of these changes and their implications for the future of business. To begin the long process of understanding the effects of computing in American business, we need to know the history of how computers were first used, by whom and why. In this, the second volume of The Digital Hand, James W. Cortada combines detailed analysis with narrative history to provide a broad overview of computing's and telecomunications' role in over a dozen industries, ranging from Old Economy sectors like finance and publishing to New Economy sectors like digital photography and video games. He also devotes considerable attention to the rapidly changing media and entertainment industries which are now some of the most technologically advanced in the American economy. Beginning in 1950, when commercial applications of digital technology began to appear, Cortada examines the ways different industries adopted new technologies, as well as the ways their innovative applications influenced other industries and the US economy as a whole. He builds on the surveys presented in the first volume of the series, which examined sixteen manufacturing, process, transportation, wholesale and retail industries. In addition to this account, of computers' impact on industries, Cortada also demonstrates how industries themselves influenced the nature of digital technology. Managers, historians and others interested in the history of modern business will appreciate this historical analysis of digital technology's many roles and future possibilities in an wide array of industries.

Based on extensive research and more than seven hundred interviews, with subjects including Andrew Young, Jesse Jackson, and Coretta Scott King, Garrow paints a multidimensional portrait of a charismatic figure driven by his strong moral obligation to lead—and of the toll this calling took on his life. Bearing the Cross provides a penetrating account of King’s spiritual development and his crucial role at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, whose protest campaigns in Birmingham and Selma, Alabama, led to enactment of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. This comprehensive yet intimate study reveals the deep sense of mission King felt to serve as an unrelenting crusader against prejudice, inequality, and violence, and his willingness to sacrifice his own life on behalf of his beliefs.

The metamorphous holds an eerie transformation, cloaked with rolling sagebrush and horse whinnies from yesteryear, which causes DPA Director, Alexis Grumman to rethink the validity of worm holes. -Basic creation is a worm hole, - replies Dr Norman Daly, -Atoms require hadrons to form a nucleus, and each hadron comes through it's own worm hole. Two quarks form the bi-dimensional plane needed to support the hole. The remaining quark squeezes through this hole, after which the first two quarks follow to shape the hadron as part of a given genetic, configuration. The hole then closes to divide time from timeless.- The gunfighter is wanted for multiple killings, a consequence that keeps the slender computer wizard on the run from authorities, and domineering wife, Ivy Chapman.

Cryoelectronics has become a special branch of cryophysics and cryotechnics and today plays a prominent role whenever high resolution and precision measurements are required. Motivated by this development, seven years ago scientists working in cryoelectronics in the Federal Republic of Germany felt the necessity for regular meetings allowing a free exchange of ideas and results achieved. Seminars under the title of ""Kryoelektronische Bauelemente"" were held for the first time at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Braunschweig in 1982 on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Walther MeiBner, a pioneer in superconductivity. Since then, meetings have been held every year at different venues in Germany. It is now felt that the status of this field necessitates a review of the results of the past, a description of the current state of the art, and a discussion of future perspectives.

The discovery of novel high polymers, the necessity of supplying a whole range of shades and increasing require ments for dyestuffs of high fastness properties give rise to a permanent search for new dyes. Extensive investigations on dyes were also occasioned by various applications in the field of spectral sensitization and of staining of biological specimens. Another more recent development concerns the lasing properties of some organic dyes. Most of the progress, however, was only achieved by time-consuming, purely empirical approaches and theoretical understanding of the dye properties is only at its very beginnings. The color is the sine qua non of every dye. For this reason organic chemists and color chemists have looked for relations between the ""color and constitution"" of dye molecules for a long time.

What, then, are we to make of the waves of Western missionaries who have, for centuries, been evangelizing in the global South? Were they merely, as many have argued, agents of imperialism out to impose Western values? In An Unpredictable Gospel, Jay Case examines the efforts of American evangelical missionaries in light of this new scholarship. He argues that if they were agents of imperialism, they were poor ones. Western missionaries had a dismal record of converting non-Westerners to Christianity. The ministries that were most successful were those that empowered the local population and adapted to local cultures. In fact, influence often flowed the other way, with missionaries serving as conduits for ideas that shaped American evangelicalism.

She is a Paladin---a holy knight blessed with the power to wield the divine Light of love and creation. Or she was, anyhow. After being convicted of blasphemy, she’s been excommunicated from the holy order and her power was taken away. Or so her superiors thought. Unbeknownst to them, despite their efforts the Light is still hers to command. She would be in terrible danger if they were to discover the truth, but she is determined to use her power to rectify a terrible mistake, whatever the personal cost. When one night she encounters a mysterious evil creature the likes of which no Paladin or Wizard has ever seen, she becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy that holds the fate of the world in the balance. As if that weren’t enough, she also loses her phone. This modern day fantasy tale is told in Adobe’s own voice. Join the potty-mouthed Paladin as she confronts the terrors of an obnoxious speech impediment, an embarrassing viral video, a far more talented and handsome rival, a phantasmal dream-walking roommate, and a wizard armed with a cricket bat and a faulty memory.

Drawn from a comprehensive survey collection of painting in the South from the late eighteenth century to the present day, the museum's opening exhibit explores an artistic terrain as rich and diverse as the South itself, arranged in categories that reflect critical chronological developments in the art world. A survey of painting activity in the South begins with the travels of itinerant portrait artists working prior to the Civil War. At the same time, landscape painting encompasses a sensitive response to the swamps, bayous and fertile fields of the South. Late in the nineteenth century strong and vivid genre painting competes with the nostalgic effects realized by Southern impressionists, whose shimmering, liquid images are invested with an elusive spirit of place. In this century, those strains of realism and naturalism that characterize the classic body of Southern writing appear in the representational art of painters who defied the modern abstract dictum. And finally, the exciting, compelling works of a current generation of both self-taught artists and sophisticated contemporary painters complete this fascinating, though sometimes neglected, chapter in American art history.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6XEfoRDycM8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The volume examines what adult writers “tell” their child readers with particular focus on the following areas: the representation of sexuality, gender and the body; the treatment of death and trauma; concepts of race, prejudice and national identity; and the use of children’s literature as a tool for socializing, acculturating, politicizing and educating children. The focus of the collection is on Irish and international fiction addressed at readers from mid-childhood to young adulthood. One section of the book examines what child readers were told in the past while another section examines young readers’ capacity for self-invention through the participatory culture of the twenty-first century. Topics explored include the controversial issue of teenage prostitution and the commodification of the male body in contemporary young adult fiction, the allure of celebrity and the impact of today’s surveillance culture on young people, the representation of the Holocaust for young readers, and representations of Muslim characters and culture in a post-9/11 mediascape. This collection, which offers insights into a range of literary constructions and representations of childhood, will be a valuable resource for students and scholars working in children’s literature, youth culture and childhood studies.

1020,1020,Latin America's Economic Challenge,['Alan Lee Keyes'],en,['Latin America'],,NOT_MATURE,,1986,3.0,9781136814525,89.15,EUR,"Latin America is one of the most interesting parts of the world. The region’s illustrious history, culture, and geography are famous internationally, but in terms of economics, Latin America has been generally associated with problems. For many, the combination of a resource rich region and poor economic conditions has been a puzzle. Latin American Economic Development provides the most up to date exploration of how this happened with a focus on why the continent can be considered to have underperformed, how the various Latin American economies function and the future prospects for the region. This textbook addresses the economic problems of Latin America theme by theme. The first four centuries of Latin American economic development are explained with reference to historical and institutional factors; the role of commodities; import substitution industrialization; and the resultant slow growth of the region. The development of Latin America during the twentieth century is examined through the policies of governments toward international trade and the management of the exchange rate. A result of these policies was the accumulation of significant debt in the region that resulted in substantial economic instability. The final section of the book explains how all of these themes have contributed to two dominant problems for the region: poverty and inequality. The purpose of this book is to provide a comprehensive text for increasingly popular undergraduate economics courses on Latin America. However, the book has been carefully designed for use by both students majoring in economics and for those in other disciplines looking for a wide-ranging guide to the region. This book should be an invaluable resource for undergraduates looking at Latin American economics, growth and development.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J3GrAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In Quinn's hands, the Irish stereotype of ""Paddy"" gives way to an image of ""Jimmy""- an archtypal Irish-American. From Irish immigration to modern politics, Quinn vibrantly weaves together the story of a remarkable people and their immeasurable contribution to American history and culture.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9DZZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
